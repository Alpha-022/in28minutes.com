  - title: Data Type
    description: In Java, a data type is a classification that determines the values, operations, and storage for a variable. 
  - title: Types of Data Type
    description: There are two types of data types in Java - primitive and reference.
  - title: Primitive Data Type 
    description: In Java, a primitive data type is a basic data type that is built into the language and is not a class.
  - title: Examples of Primitive Data Type 
    description: There are eight primitive data types in Java - boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float, and double. 
  - title: boolean
    description: boolean represents a logical value, either true or false. 
  - title: char
    description: char represents a single character.
  - title: byte
    description: byte represents an 8-bit integer.
  - title: short
    description: short represents a 16-bit integer.
  - title: int
    description: int represents a 32-bit integer.
  - title: long
    description: long represents a 64-bit integer.
  - title: float
    description: float represents a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating-point number.
  - title: double
    description: double represents a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point number.
  - title: Reference data types
    description: Reference data types are objects and arrays, and they are stored on the heap rather than on the stack like primitive types.
  - title: Note **DataType
    description: It's important to choose the appropriate data type for your variables based on the values they will hold. Using a data type that is too small to hold a value can cause loss of precision, and using a data type that is too large can waste memory and processing resources.
