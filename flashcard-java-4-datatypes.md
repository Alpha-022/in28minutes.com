  - title: Typecasting 
    description: In Java, typecasting refers to the process of converting a variable from one data type to another.
  - title: Overflow 
    description: In Java, an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation results in a value that is too large to be stored in the variable's data type.
  - title: Final Variables
