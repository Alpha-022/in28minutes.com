  - title: Primitive Data types 
    description: Basic building blocks of data in Java such as integers, booleans, and characters
  - title: byte
    description: In Java, the range of byte data type is from -128 to 127. It is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer.
  - title: short
    description: Short represents a 16-bit integer. In Java, the range of a short data type is from -32,768 to 32,767 (inclusive).
  - title: int
    description: Integer represents a 32-bit integer. The range of int in Java is -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
  - title: long
    description: Represents a 64-bit integer. The range is -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
  - title: float
    description: Represents a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating-point number. The range is approximately 3.4E-38 to 3.4E+38.
  - title: double
    description: Represents a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point number. The range is approximately 4.9e-324 to 1.8e+308.
  - title: Typecasting
    description: Process of converting one data type into another
  - title: Lossy conversion

  - title: Explicit Cast
    description: A type conversion that is explicitly declared by the programmer.
  - title: BigDecimal
    description: BigDecimal is a Java class for precise arithmetic operations on very large or very small numbers.
  - title: Boolean
    description: Boolean in Java is a data type that represents true or false values.
  - title: A "||" operator
    description: Logical operator used for OR operations
  - title: A "&&" operator
    description: Logical operator that performs a "and" operation between two boolean values
  - title: Not operator
    description: Represented by the exclamation mark (!) and is used to negate a boolean value
  - title: char
    description: Data type that represents a single character
