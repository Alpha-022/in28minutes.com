  - title: Primitive Data types 
    description: The basic building blocks of data in Java such as integers, booleans, and characters.
  - title: byte
    description: In Java, the range of byte data type is from -128 to 127. It is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer.
  - title: short
    description: Short represents a 16-bit integer. In Java, the range of a short data type is from -32,768 to 32,767 (inclusive).
  - title: int
    description: Integer represents a 32-bit integer. The range of int in Java is -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
  - title: long
    description: Long represents a 64-bit integer. The range of long in Java is -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
  - title: float
    description: Float represents a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating-point number. The range of a float in Java is approximately 3.4E-38 to 3.4E+38.
  - title: double
    description: Double represents a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point number. The range of a double in Java is approximately 4.9e-324 to 1.8e+308.
  - title: Typecasting
    description: Typecasting in Java is the process of converting one data type into another.
  - title: Lossy conversion
    description: Lossy conversion in Java refers to data compression that results in loss of information.
  - title: Explicit Cast
    description: An explicit cast in Java is a type conversion that is explicitly declared by the programmer.
  - title: BigDecimal
    description: BigDecimal is a Java class for precise arithmetic operations on very large or very small numbers.
  - title: Boolean
    description: Boolean in Java is a data type that represents true or false values.
  - title: What is "||" operator?
    description: In Java, "||" is a logical operator used for OR operations.
  - title: What is "&&" operator?
    description: In Java "&&" is a logical operator that performs a "and" operation between two boolean values.
  - title: ^ Operator
    description: ^ is a bitwise operator in Java used for performing XOR operations.
  - title: Not operator
    description: Not operator in Java is represented by the exclamation mark (!) and is used to negate a boolean value.
  - title: Short Circuit Operators
    description: Short Circuit Operators in Java are used for optimizing logical expressions and improving program efficiency.
  - title: Char
    description: Char in Java is a data type that represents a single character.
  - title: Unicode value
    description: Unicode value in Java is the numeric representation of a character.
