## <a id="info"></a> Topics with detaild explanation:
***Note***: **Utilize this information first to create Image**

### <a id="serverless"></a> Serverless
- You don't worry about infrastructure
    - You have ZERO visibility into infrastructure
    - Flexible scaling and automated high availability
- Most Important: Pay for use
    - Ideally ZERO REQUESTS => ZERO COST
- You focus on code and the cloud managed service takes care of all that is needed to scale your code to serve millions of requests!
    - And you pay for requests and NOT servers!
- Key Features:
    1) : Zero worry about infrastructure, scaling and availability
    2) : Zero invocations => Zero Cost (Can you scale down to ZERO instances?)
    3) : Pay for invocations and NOT for instances (or nodes or servers)

- Serverless Levels:
    - Serverless Level 1: Features (1 + 2)
    - Serverless Level 2: Features (1 + 2 + 3)
- When I refer to Serverless, I'm referring to Level 2
- HOWEVER cloud providers include managed services at Level 1 and Level 2:
    - Level 1: Google App Engine (Google Calls it "App Engine is a fully managed, serverless platform"), AWS Fargate (AWS calls it "serverless compute engine for containers")
        - Scale down to ZERO instances when there is no load, BUT you pay for number (and type) of instances running!
    - Level 2: Google Cloud Functions, AWS Lambda, Azure Functions etc
You pay for invocations

### <a id="microservice"></a> Microservices (Docker)
Microservice 1 > Microservice 2 > Microservice 3 > Microservice 4 > Microservice 5 (Each microservice calling another. Also show that each microservice has its own database. Show that different microservices are built with different languages. Also show that each microservice can have different number of instances active at a specific point in time.)

- Enterprises are heading towards microservices architectures
- Approach: Build small focused microservices instead of large applications
- Why?
    - Innovation because of Faster Release Cycles
    - Flexibility to build applications in different programming languages (Go, Java, Python, JavaScript, etc)
    - Flexibility in scaling
- Cost of Flexibility:
    - Microservices need complex features AND
    - Deployments become complex!
    - How can we have one way of deploying Go, Java, Python or JavaScript .. microservices?
        - Enter containers!


### <a id="oops"></a> Object-Oriented Programming

### <a id="networking"></a> HTTP vs HTTPS vs TCP vs TLS vs UDP
- Network Layer:
    - IP (Internet Protocol): Transfer bytes. Unreliable.
- Transport Layer:
    - TCP (Transmission Control): Reliability > Performance
    - TLS (Transport Layer Security): Secure TCP
    - UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Performance > Reliability
- Application Layer:
    - HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Stateless Request Response Cycle
    - HTTPS: Secure HTTP
    - SMTP: Email Transfer Protocol
    - and a lot of others...
- Most applications typically communicate at application layer
    - Web apps/REST API(HTTP/HTTPS), Email Servers(SMTP), File Transfers(FTP)
    - All these applications use TCP/TLS at network layer(for reliability)
- HOWEVER applications needing high performance directly communicate at transport layer:
    - Gaming applications and live video streaming use UDP (sacrifice reliability for performance)
- Objective: Understand the Big Picture. It's OK if you do not understand all the details.



### <a id="security"></a> Symmetric Key Encryption & Asymmetric Key Encryption
- Symmetric Key Encryption
    - Symmetric encryption algorithms use the same key for encryption and decryption
    - Key Factor 1: Choose the right encryption algorithm
    - Key Factor 2: How do we secure the encryption key?
    - Key Factor 3: How do we share the encryption key?

- ASymmetric Key Encryption
    - Two Keys : Public Key and Private Key
    - Also called Public Key Cryptography
    - Encrypt data with Public Key and decrypt with Private Key
    - Share Public Key with everybody and keep the Private Key with you(YEAH, IT'S PRIVATE!)
    - No crazy questions:
    - Will somebody not figure out the private key using the public key?
    - How do you create keys in the cloud?
        - AWS: AWS KMS
        - Azure: Azure Key Vault
        - Google Cloud: Cloud KMS and Cloud H
