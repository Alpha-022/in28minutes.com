  - title: variable
    description: n Java, a variable is a location in memory where a programmer can store a value. 
  - title: Primitive variables
    description: These are variables that hold a single value of a primitive data type, such as an integer, float, or boolean.
  - title: Reference variables
    description: These are variables that hold a reference to an object in memory. They do not contain the object itself, but rather a reference to the object's location in memory.
    description: In Java, a local variable is a variable that is defined within a method, constructor, or block of code. Local variables are only visible and accessible within the block of code in which they are defined, and they are not accessible from outside the block.
  - title: Instance variables
    description: In Java, an instance variable is a variable that is defined in a class, but outside of any method. Instance variables are unique to each instance of a class, meaning that each object of a class has its own copy of the instance variables.
  - title: Static variable
    description: In Java, a static variable is a variable that is shared by all instances of a class. This means that there is only one copy of the static variable, regardless of how many objects of the class are created.
  - title: Example to understand the types of variables in java
    description: test
  - title: Typecasting 
    description: In Java, typecasting refers to the process of converting a variable from one data type to another.
  - title: Overflow 
    description: In Java, an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation results in a value that is too large to be stored in the variable's data type.
  - title: Final Variables
    description: In Java, a final variable is a variable that cannot be reassigned. Once a value is assigned to a final variable, it cannot be changed.
