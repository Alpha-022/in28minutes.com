  - title: Control flow statements
    description: Java control flow statements are statements that control the order in which statements are executed in a Java program, based on specified conditions or values. 
  - title: Types of Control flow statements
    description: Java provides three types of control flow statements. Decision Making statements, Loop statements, Jump statements
  - title: Decision Making Statements
    description: Decision making statements in Java allow you to specify different paths of execution in your code based on the results of boolean expressions.
  - title: Types of Decision Making Statements
    description: There are two types of decision making statements in Java - if-else statements, switch statements
  - title: if-else statements
    description: The if-else statement allows you to specify two different blocks of code to be executed, depending on whether a boolean condition is true or false.
  - title: switch statements
    description: The switch statement is an alternative to the if-else statement for specifying multiple blocks of code to be executed based on the value of a variable.
  - title: loop statement
    description: Java loop statements repeat code execution.
  - title: Types of loop statement in Java
    description: In Java, there are several types of loop statements including for, while, and do-while.
  - title: for loop
    description: The for loop is used to iterate a specific number of times. 
  - title: for loop syntax
    description: for (initialization; condition; iteration) { // code to be executed }
  - title: while loop
    description: The while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is met. 
  - title: while loop syntax
    description: while (condition) { //code to be executed }
  - title: do-while loop
    description: The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it executes the code block at least once before checking the condition.
  - title: do-while loop syntax
    description: do { // code to be executed } while (condition);
  - title: enhanced for loop
    description: enhanced for loop (also known as the "for-each" loop) which is used to iterate over a collection of elements, such as arrays or lists.
  - title: enhanced for loop syntax
    description: for (type variable ':' collection) { // code to be executed }
  - title: jump statements in java
    description: Jump statements in Java allow exiting loops, skipping iterations, exiting methods, throwing exceptions, pausing thread execution.
  - title: types of jump statements in java
    description: break, continue, return, and throw.
  - title: break statement
    description: The break statement is used to exit a loop or a switch statement
  - title: continue statement
    description: The continue statement is used to skip over one iteration of a loop.
  - title: eturn statement
    description: The return statement is used to exit a method and return a value (if the method is non-void). It can also be used to exit a constructor.
  - title: throw statement
    description: The throw statement is used to throw an exception.
  - title: yield statement
    description: used to pause the execution of the current thread and allow other threads to execute, but it's not a common statement, and it's mostly used in multi-threading environments.
