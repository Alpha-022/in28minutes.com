cards:
  - title: Programming
    description: Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a particular task
  - title: Programming Language
    description: A programming language is a type of written language that tells computers what to do. 
  - title: What is Java?
    description: Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
  - title: JShell
    description: The Java Shell tool (JShell) is an interactive Read-Evaluate-Print Loop (REPL) tool for learning the Java programming language and prototyping Java code.
  - title: Compiler
    description: A compiler in Java converts the source code into a machine-code or bytecode code, and that is then executed. It is platform-independent.
  - title: System & out
    description: System is a final class defined in the java. lang package. Out is an instance of PrintStream type, which is a public and static member field of the System class. 
  - title: print() vs println()
    description: The prints method simply print text on the console and does not add any new line. While println adds new line after print text on console.
  - title: printf()
    description: The Java printf function helps simplify the task of printing formatted output to the console, terminal window or log files.
  - title: System.out.print()
    description: In Java, System.out.println() is a statement which prints the argument passed inside it. The print() method display results on the console.
  - title: variable
    description: In Java, a variable is a location in memory where a programmer can store a value. 
  - title: Primitive variables
    description: These are variables that hold a single value of a primitive data type, such as an integer, float, or boolean.
  - title: Reference variables
    description: These are variables that hold a reference to an object in memory. They do not contain the object itself, but rather a reference to the object's location in memory.
  - title: Local variable
    description: In Java, a local variable is a variable that is defined within a method, constructor, or block of code. 
  - title: Instance variables
    description: In Java, an instance variable is a variable that is defined in a class, but outside of any method. 
  - title: Static variable
    description: In Java, a static variable is a variable that is shared by all instances of a class. 
  - title: Final Variables
    description: In Java, a final variable is a variable that cannot be reassigned. Once a value is assigned to a final variable, it cannot be changed.
  - title: Data Type
    description: In Java, a data type is a classification that determines the values, operations, and storage for a variable. 
  - title: Types of Data Type
    description: There are two types of data types in Java - primitive and reference.
  - title: Primitive Data Type 
    description: In Java, a primitive data type is a basic data type that is built into the language and is not a class.
  - title: Examples of Primitive Data Type 
    description: There are eight primitive data types in Java - boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float, and double. 
  - title: boolean
    description: boolean represents a logical value, either true or false. 
  - title: char
    description: char represents a single character.
  - title: byte
    description: byte represents an 8-bit integer.
  - title: short
    description: short represents a 16-bit integer.
  - title: int
    description: int represents a 32-bit integer.
  - title: long
    description: long represents a 64-bit integer.
  - title: float
    description: float represents a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating-point number.
  - title: double
    description: double represents a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point number.
  - title: Reference data types
    description: Reference data types are objects and arrays, and they are stored on the heap rather than on the stack like primitive types.
  - title: Note **DataType
    description: Using a data type that is too small to hold a value can cause loss of precision, and using a data type that is too large can waste memory and processing resources.
  - title: String
    description: In Java, a string is an object that represents a sequence of characters.
  - title: Nature of Strings
    description: Strings are immutable, which means that once you create a string, you cannot change its contents. Instead, you can create a new string with the desired modifications.
  - title: Concatenating strings 
    description: You can use the + operator to concatenate two strings.
  - title: Control flow statements
    description: Java control flow statements are statements that control the order in which statements are executed in a Java program, based on specified conditions or values. 
  - title: Types of Control flow statements
    description: Java provides three types of control flow statements. Decision Making statements, Loop statements, Jump statements
  - title: Decision Making Statements
    description: Decision making statements in Java allow you to specify different paths of execution in your code based on the results of boolean expressions.
  - title: Types of Decision Making Statements
    description: There are two types of decision making statements in Java - if-else statements, switch statements
  - title: if-else statements
    description: The if-else statement allows you to specify two different blocks of code to be executed, depending on whether a boolean condition is true or false.
  - title: loop statement
    description: Java loop statements repeat code execution.
  - title: Types of loop statement in Java
    description: In Java, there are several types of loop statements including for, while, and do-while.
  - title: for loop
    description: The for loop is used to iterate a specific number of times. 
  - title: for loop syntax
    description: for (initialization; condition; iteration) { // code to be executed }
