  - title: loop statement
    description: Java loop statements repeat code execution.
  - title: Types of loop statement in Java
    description: In Java, there are several types of loop statements including for, while, and do-while.
  - title: for loop
    description: The for loop is used to iterate a specific number of times. 
  - title: for loop syntax
    description: for (initialization; condition; iteration) { // code to be executed }
  - title: while loop
    description: The while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is met. 
  - title: while loop syntax
    description: while (condition) { //code to be executed }
  - title: do-while loop
    description: The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it executes the code block at least once before checking the condition.
  - title: do-while loop syntax
    description: do { // code to be executed } while (condition);
  - title: enhanced for loop
    description: enhanced for loop (also known as the "for-each" loop) which is used to iterate over a collection of elements, such as arrays or lists.
  - title: enhanced for loop syntax
    description: for (type variable ':' collection) { // code to be executed }
  - title: jump statements in java
    description: Jump statements in Java allow exiting loops, skipping iterations, exiting methods, throwing exceptions, pausing thread execution.
  - title: types of jump statements in java
    description: break, continue, return, and throw.
  - title: break statement
    description: The break statement is used to exit a loop or a switch statement
  - title: continue statement
    description: The continue statement is used to skip over one iteration of a loop.
